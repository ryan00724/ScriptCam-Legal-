## 2. Subscription & Payments

Premium features are unlocked via in-app purchases or subscriptions managed through the Apple App Store or Google Play. All billing, renewal, and cancellations are handled by those platforms.

### Lifetime Purchase:
A one-time payment provides permanent access to premium features.

Please refer to Apple or Google’s policies for subscription management and refund requests.

You agree to the terms of those providers when using their integrated features.

## 6. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the App if you violate these Terms or use the App in a way that harms others or disrupts services.

## 7. Disclaimer

ScriptCam is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free or continuously available.
